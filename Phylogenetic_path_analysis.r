###Phylogenetic path analysis

#First define a set of models, the first group will involve models where alometry (i.e. body mass) 
#determines the life-history traits, and then variations of these life-history traits, as well as 
#dispersal and body mass itself, will affect longevity. The second group of models will involve life-history traits 
#determined by brain size (reflecting the idea of energetic constraints imposed by brain size 
#(see e.g. Barton and Capellini 2011 and Gonzalez-Voyer et al 2016) and then these life-history traits, 
#and brain size as well as dispersal, affecting longevity. Finally, the last set of models will involve a combination 
#of allometry and brain size influencing life-history traits. Such a combination of models will allow us to both distinguish 
#between purely allometric, purely energetic cost of brain size effects on life-history traits, as well as to analyze the causal 
#effects of body size, brain size, life-history and dispersal on longevity. 

#Create another database with simplified variable names, as I will need to type these in multiple times for the path models.

#Take a two-step approach for the path models, first to define the relationships between body mass, brain size and the life-history traits 
#and then fix those to the ones found to fit the data best - and for which all conditional independencies are met - and then 
#explore the relationships with longevity. So below is a set of path models describing potential causal relationships between mass, brain size and life-history traits.
